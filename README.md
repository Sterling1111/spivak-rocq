# spivak-rocq

A formal, textbook-style development of single-variable calculus and supporting real analysis in the Coq proof assistant. While the project uses the standard library `Reals` type as its foundation for the real numbers, **all other calculus infrastructure (limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, sequences, and transcendental functions) is built completely independently from scratch**. This formalization strictly follows the presentation and problem sequence of Michael Spivak’s "Calculus". The repository includes a reusable library (`Lib/`) plus worked problems for the Calculus track (`Calculus/`) and companion materials (`ATTAM/`).

## Highlights

Below are representative theorems with their exact Coq statements using this project's notations.

- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus — part I and II (file: `Lib/Integral.v`)

```coq

  a < b -> continuous_on f [a, b] -> ⟦ der ⟧ (λ x, ∫ a x f) [a, b] = f.

Theorem FTC1' : ∀ f a b,
  a < b -> continuous_on f [a, b] -> ⟦ der ⟧ (λ x, ∫ x b f) [a, b] = - f.

Additional substantial developments include limits and continuity laws (`Lib/Limit.v`, `Lib/Continuity.v`), derivatives and rules (`Lib/Derivative.v`), series and sequences (`Lib/Series.v`, `Lib/Sequence.v`), and a Riemann-style integral with partitions (`Lib/Integral.v`). The trigonometry module derives classical results from integral definitions.

## Standard Library Compatibility (`Lib/Compat.v`)

An extensive compatibility layer bridges the custom definitions in this repository directly to Coq's standard library `Reals`. This makes it possible to seamlessly interoperate between this project's foundational calculus theorems and external Coq developments:
- **Core Calculus**: Equivalences for limits, continuity, derivatives, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
- **Transcendental Functions**: Custom definitions for trigonometric functions, `exp`, `log`, as well as constants `PI` and `e` are formally proven equivalent to their `Reals` counterparts.

## Custom Automation

To efficiently discharge complex differential, continuity, and limit goals without manually applying properties like the chain rule or product rule, this project provides a robust custom tactical suite: `auto_diff`, `auto_cont`, and `auto_limit`. These heavily optimize evaluation and avoid the overhead of manually decomposing layered compositions.

For example, `auto_diff` can instantly solve deeply nested derivative problems (e.g. from Spivak's Chapter 10, Problem 1) purely through automation:

```coq
Lemma lemma_10_1_viii : ⟦ der ⟧ (λ x, sin (cos (sin x))) = (λ x, cos (cos (sin x)) * (- sin (sin x) * cos x)).
Proof. auto_diff. Qed.
```

Similarly, `auto_limit` can automatically evaluate limits of complicated expressions (e.g. from Chapter 5, Problem 1) and `auto_cont` can effortlessly prove continuity over intervals (e.g. from Chapter 11, Problem 1):

```coq
Lemma lemma_5_1_iii : ⟦ lim 3 ⟧ (λ x, (x^3 - 8) / (x - 2)) = 19.
Proof. auto_limit. Qed.

Lemma example_cont : continuous_on (λ x, x^5 + x + 1) [-1, 1].
Proof. auto_cont. Qed.
```


## Repository structure

- `Lib/`: Core theory (limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, sequences/series, completeness, sets, polynomials, etc.). Reusable across problem sets.
- `Calculus/`: Chapter- and problem-indexed files with worked formal proofs from the Calculus text. Currently features 603 stated problems, with **145 problems fully verified** (zero admitted lemmas).

- `ATTAM/`: Companion chapters depending only on `Lib/`.
- `_RocqProject`: Coq project configuration (logical roots and file list).

## How to build and explore

This project is built and verified using **The Rocq Prover, version 9.1.1** (formerly Coq). 

### Prerequisites

**Python Dependencies (Required for the `auto_int` tactic)**
The automated integration tactic (`auto_int`) uses a Python script (`auto_int.py`) bridging Coq and the SymPy computer algebra system. You must have Python 3 and SymPy installed to use it:
```bash
pip install sympy
```

**C++ Simplex Solver (Optional)**
The project will compile successfully even if the C++ simplex program is not built. However, the custom `psatz` tactic for real linear arithmetic will not work without it. Note that this tactic was merely an experiment to implement the ideas from the paper *Fast Reflexive Tactics* and should generally not be used anyway (rely on `lia` or `lra` instead). If you still wish to compile it:

```bash
# From the repo root
g++ -O3 simplex.cpp -o simplex_solver
```

### Compiling the Project

The recommended way to build the project is by generating a `Makefile` from the `_RocqProject` file using `rocq makefile` (part of Rocq/Coq's standard tooling) and then running `make`.

```bash
# Generate the Makefile
rocq makefile -f _RocqProject -o Makefile

# Build everything listed in _RocqProject concurrently
make -j

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

If `rocq makefile` is not found, install the `coq` package from your OS or opam, or ensure it is on your PATH.

Alternatively, you can load the project in CoqIDE/VS Code with the `_RocqProject` file so qualified paths (`Lib/…`, `Calculus/…`) resolve automatically.
